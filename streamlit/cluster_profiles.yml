  name: "Moderate Spring–Autumn Pollution"
  summary: "Transitional-season conditions with moderate PM2.5 levels and mild meteorology."
  notes:
    - "Primarily associated with spring and autumn periods."
    - "PM2.5 levels are elevated but not extreme."
    - "Represents transitional atmospheric conditions with limited stagnation."

1:
  name: "Clean Winter High-Pressure Days"
  summary: "Cold, dry winter conditions with very low PM2.5 concentrations."
  notes:
    - "Dominated by winter observations."
    - "High-pressure systems promote atmospheric stability without pollution build-up."
    - "Represents clean, crisp winter air episodes."

2:
  name: "Clean, Cool Spring Days"
  summary: "Low PM2.5 levels under cool and dry spring conditions with strong dispersion."
  notes:
    - "Spring-heavy cluster composition."
    - "Consistently among the lowest PM2.5 concentrations."
    - "Good atmospheric mixing reduces pollutant accumulation."

3:
  name: "Warm-Season Moderate Pollution"
  summary: "Warm summer conditions with noticeable but moderate PM2.5 pollution."
  notes:
    - "Predominantly summer observations."
    - "Moderate haze under warm temperatures."
    - "Pollution present but below severe episode thresholds."

4:
  name: "Rain-Driven Clean Days"
  summary: "Low PM2.5 levels associated with precipitation events."
  notes:
    - "All observations coincide with rainfall."
    - "Wet deposition effectively removes airborne pollutants."
    - "Cleaner air compared to dry conditions across seasons."

5:
  name: "Mixed-Season Moderate Pollution"
  summary: "Variable meteorological conditions producing inconsistent PM2.5 levels."
  notes:
    - "Includes observations from multiple seasons."
    - "Moderate average PM2.5 with high variability."
    - "Functions as a heterogeneous or transitional cluster."

6:
  name: "Cold Polluted Winter Cluster"
  summary: "Cold, stagnant winter conditions with elevated PM2.5 concentrations."
  notes:
    - "Winter-dominated with low temperatures."
    - "Higher PM2.5 likely linked to heating emissions and weak dispersion."
    - "Represents winter haze-type pollution events."

7:
  name: "Severe Warm-Season Pollution"
  summary: "Hot, stagnant summer conditions producing very high PM2.5 levels."
  notes:
    - "Strongly summer-dominated cluster."
    - "Highest PM2.5 concentrations among all clusters."
    - "Represents severe warm-season pollution episodes."
