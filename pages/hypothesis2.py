        Hypothesis 2 is supported — PM2.5 levels differ significantly across

                **What this shows:**
                This table summarises the mean, median, standard
                deviation, and range of PM2.5 for each of Beijing's
                12 monitoring stations. It highlights both central tendency
                and variability, making it easy to compare pollution levels
                between stations.

                **Why it matters:**
                Understanding basic descriptive statistics reveals which
                stations consistently experience higher or lower pollution
                and whether certain locations show more extreme PM2.5 spikes.
                This evidence directly supports assessing spatial variation.

                **Key takeaway:**
                Stations differ noticeably in both average PM2.5 and
                variability, suggesting that spatial location plays a
                meaningful role in pollution exposure.

                Boxplots are ideal for comparing multiple groups. They quickly
                show whether some stations have systematically higher typical
                PM2.5 or wider ranges, supporting the hypothesis of spatial
                differences.

                **Key takeaway:**
                Some stations — particularly urban ones — consistently show
                higher typical PM2.5 and a wider spread, reinforcing that
                spatial location impacts pollution intensity.

                The distribution shapes differ notably between stations,
