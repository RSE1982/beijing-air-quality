# 📘 Beijing Air Quality Analysis & Forecasting
## A Code Institute Data Analytics with AI Capstone Project
**Author:** Robert Steven Elliott

**Objective:** Analyse Beijing’s multi-station air quality data, identify temporal + spatial pollution patterns, and build machine learning models (baseline + lag-based) to forecast PM2.5 concentrations.

## Dataset Content

This project uses the Beijing Multi-Site Air Quality Dataset, originally published by Song Chen (2017) and hosted on the UCI Machine Learning Repository (with a Kaggle mirror).

It contains hourly pollution and meteorological observations from 12 monitoring stations across Beijing, including:

- PM2.5
- Temperature, dew point, pressure, and rainfall
- Wind direction and speed
- Station identifiers and timestamps

The cleaned and engineered datasets have been optimised for GitHub storage using the Parquet format due to GitHub’s 100 MB file limit.
