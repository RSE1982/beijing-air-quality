description: Dataset with lag features, rolling windows, seasonal categories, cyclical
  encodings, and spatial metadata.
created_on: '2025-12-04 09:57:06'
created_by: Robert Steven Elliott
steps:
- 'Extracted datetime feature: dayofweek'
- Encoded hour and month as cyclical sin/cos
- Created lag features (1h, 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h)
- Created rolling mean features (3h, 6h, 12h, 24h)
- Created dewpoint spread feature
- Created temperature-pressure interaction feature
- Created binary rain feature
- Saved dataset as Parquet for GitHub compliance
- Saved dataset as CSV for GitHub compliance
