description: Dataset with lag features, rolling windows, seasonal categories, cyclical
  encodings, and spatial metadata.
created_on: '2025-12-03 08:33:58'
created_by: Robert Steven Elliott
steps:
- Merged spatial metadata (latitude, longitude, area type)
- Converted 'station' and 'area_type' columns to categorical data types
- 'Extracted datetime features: year, month, day, hour, dayofweek'
- Added season variable
- Encoded hour and month as cyclical sin/cos
- Created lag features (1h, 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h)
- Created rolling mean features (3h, 6h, 12h, 24h)
- Created dewpoint spread feature
- Created temperature-pressure interaction feature
- Created binary rain feature
- Saved dataset as Parquet for GitHub compliance
