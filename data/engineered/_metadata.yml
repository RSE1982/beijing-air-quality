description: Dataset with lag features, rolling windows, seasonal categories, cyclical
  encodings, and spatial metadata.
created_on: '2025-12-07 20:43:26'
created_by: Robert Steven Elliott
steps:
- Encoded hour as cyclical sin/cos
- Encoded month as cyclical sin/cos
- Created dew_point_spread feature
- Created temperature-pressure interaction feature
- Created binary rain feature
- Saved dataset as Parquet for GitHub compliance
- Noted presence of NaN rows from lag features (to be handled in modelling step)
