description: Dataset with lag features, rolling windows, seasonal categories, cyclical
  encodings, and spatial metadata.
created_on: '2025-12-10 08:52:18'
created_by: Robert Steven Elliott
steps:
- Encoded hour as cyclical sin/cos
- Encoded month as cyclical sin/cos
- Created dew_point_spread feature
- Created temperature-pressure interaction feature
- Created binary rain feature
- Computed relative humidity from temperature and dew point
- Saved dataset as CSV
